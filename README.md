# ðŸ§ª Fault
Fault is an automatic test pattern generator for netlists that includes scan chain stitching, synthesis scripts and a number of other convenience features.

# Quick Usage Instructions
A Docker image is available for Fault:
```sh
docker run -tiv `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm cloudv/fault:latest fault -V
```

For quick further runs, you can add this to your shell's profile:
```sh
alias fault='docker run -tiv `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --rm cloudv/fault:latest fault'
```

Then you can just invoke `fault -V`.

## Running
### Subcommands
#### synth
Synth is a synthesis script included with Fault that generates both a netlist and a cut-away version.

To run it, `fault synth --top <your-top-module> --liberty <your-liberty-file> <your-file>`. You can optionally omit` --liberty` where osu035 will be used.

For more options, you can invoke `fault synth --help`.

#### cut
`fault cut <your-netlist>`

This exposes the D-flipflops as ports for use with the main script.

For more options, you can invoke `fault cut --help`.

#### main
`fault --cellModel <your-cell-models> <your-file>`, `--cellModel` behaving similar to `--liberty` in synth.

A set of assumptions are made about the input file:
* It is a netlist
* It is flattened (there is only one module with no submodules)
* The flipflops have been cut away and replaced with outputs and inputs.

Generated test vectors are printed to stdout by default, but you can use `-o <file>` (or simply redirect the output).

For more options, you can invoke `fault --help`.

### chain
`fault chain --liberty <your-liberty-file> --clock <clockName> --reset <resetName> <--activeLow> <your-file>`, `--liberty` behaving identical to Synth.

Chain is another synthesis script that links registers together for scan insertion. It takes all the assumptions made in the main program but the last, and one more:
* All instantiated D flipflops start with "DFF".

A note about the liberty file in use in this step is that we recommend a modified liberty file that keeps only a buffer, an and gate, and a multiplexer (and an inverter if necessary), as abc tends to overthink multiplexers.

Chain will output information about the scan chain embedded in the output netlist as `/* FAULT METADATA: '<json>' */` after the boilerplate. This metadata includes things like port names, the DFF count and the order of the registers in the scan chain.

You can have Chain automagically verify its generated scanchain-- see the help for more options, but the gist of it is `-v <your-cell-model>`.

For more options, you can invoke `fault chain --help`.

### asm
`fault asm <test vector json> <chained netlist>`, in any order, will assemble a .bin file for use with `$readmemb`.

For more options, you can invoke `fault asm --help`.

### compact
`fault compact <test vector json>`

This performs static compaction on the generated test vectors by reducing the test vectors count while keeping the same coverage.

For more options, you can invoke `fault compact --help`.

# Building from source/local installation
## Dependencies
* Swift 5.0+
* Python 3.6+ with PIP
* Yosys 0.7+
* Icarus Verilog 10.2+

### Installing
#### macOS
Install the latest Xcode from the Mac App Store.

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

`brew install python yosys icarus-verilog`

#### Debian-based Linuces (e.g. Ubuntu)
Using apt:

`sudo apt-get install git clang python3 python3-dev yosys`

Then install the Swift programming language: instructions are on [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#using-downloads).

Notice how Icarus Verilog is excluded. This is because as of the time of writing, there is no version of Swift on a version of Ubuntu that has Icarus Verilog 10.2 or above. Which is ridiculous. You'll have to build it from source. First, grab these dev dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install autoconf make gperf flex bison`

Then just run these in a terminal instance.

```bash
EXEC_PREFIX=<wherever, i prefer /usr/local and it will be /usr/local by default but you do you>
sudo ./iverilog_build.swift
```

## Installation
Type `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the terminal to initialize submodules.

Then simply invoke `swift install.swift`. This will install it to `~/bin` by default, type `swift install.swift help me` for more options.

## Usage without installing
A special consideration is osu035 will not be used automatically.
