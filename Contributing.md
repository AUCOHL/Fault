# How to Contribute
We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

# Branching
For various reasons, it's recommended to call working branches, even in your forks, something else other than `main`, as this branch name does have some special behavior associated with them. 

# Testing and Code Standards
Before you submit your changes, it's prudent to perform some kind of smoke test. `swift test` will do just fine.

Please do not write new shell scripts.

# Submissions
Make your changes and then submit them as a pull requests to the `main` branch.

Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

# Licensing and Copyright
Please add your (or your employer's) copyright headers to any files to which you have made major edits.

Please note all code contributions must have the same license as Fault, i.e., the Apache License, version 2.0.
